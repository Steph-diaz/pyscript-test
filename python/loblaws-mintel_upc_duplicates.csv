Real, simple ingredients. Nothing fake.

A pop of positivity
Back when Dan and I first started popping popcorn in our Mankato, Minnesota garage, we wanted to teach our kids the value of hard work and have a little fun along the way. We also wanted a snack we felt good about feeding them. Hugely flavourful snacks made with real, simple ingredients - you know, ingredients you don't have to scrunch up your face to say. Snacks packed with positivity, not guilt.
But what if you want to eat your popcorn warm, to moment it pops? Zip, zoom, boom! Angie's Boomchickapop microwave popcorn saves the day.
